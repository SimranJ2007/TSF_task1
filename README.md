# TSF_task1
My first repository on GitHub

I have made a Basic Banking System website. Here there is a HomePage which links to other page with User info and Transaction details. Also, the details of Users have been made using php connecting it with database. Similarly with the transaction details. The languages used are HTML, CSS, js and a bit of SQL queries. practice3.php shows user table and money transfer form, practice2.php deals with transaction table. sparks.css gives style to HomePage.php while in others it is included within head.
