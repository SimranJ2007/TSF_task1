# TSF_task1
My first repository on GitHub

I have made a Basic Banking System website. The languages used are HTML, CSS, js and a bit of SQL queries. I have created a homepage(HomePage.php) which links other pages having user info(practice3.php & try.php) and transaction info(practice2.php and master.php) while sparks.css gives style to homepage. The tables info have been made using phpmyadmin(database).
